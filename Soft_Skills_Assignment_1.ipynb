        "Ethics and morality are closely related but distinct concepts. While they both involve principles and values that guide our behavior, there are some differences between the two:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ethics refers to a set of principles and standards that govern professional conduct or behavior within a specific context, such as a profession or an organization. It defines what is considered right or wrong in a professional context and provides guidelines for decision-making and behavior. Ethical standards are often established by professional bodies or organizations to ensure integrity, fairness, and accountability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Morality, on the other hand, encompasses broader principles and values that govern human behavior in general. It is more subjective and personal, rooted in an individual's beliefs, cultural upbringing, and personal experiences. Morality guides our choices and actions based on our understanding of what is right or wrong, just or unjust, regardless of any specific professional or organizational context.\n",
        "\n",
        "While ethics provides a framework for professional conduct, morality encompasses a broader sense of right and wrong that extends beyond professional boundaries. Ethics can be seen as a subset of morality, focusing specifically on the principles and values that apply within a professional or organizational setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both ethics and morality play a crucial role in guiding our actions and decisions, ensuring that we act in accordance with principles that are morally acceptable and aligned with professional standards. Understanding and adhering to ethical principles in the workplace contribute to creating a culture of trust, integrity, and accountability."
